## 🔍 Key Discoveries & Issues

### Issue #1: Missing Demo Script Files (FIXED ✅)

**Problem:**
- `scripts/demo/visualize.ts` was missing
- `scripts/demo/patterns.ts` was missing
- Only `analyze.ts` existed

**Impact:**
- New developers couldn't run visualization demo
- Pattern detection demo failed
- First-time experience was broken

**Resolution:**
- Created `visualize.ts` with interactive HTML generation
- Created `patterns.ts` with comprehensive pattern analysis
- Both scripts now work successfully

**Verification:**
```bash
npm run demo:visualize  # ✅ Works - generates dist/visualizations/component-tree.html
npm run demo:patterns   # ✅ Works - shows pattern analysis
```

---

### Issue #2: Analysis Script Component Detection

**Problem:**
- `demo:analyze` finds 0 components (should find 11)
- Files are detected (13 files found ✅)
- But component parsing/extraction is not working

**Impact:**
- New developers see "0 components found" despite 13 files
- Confusing first impression
- Makes tool appear broken

**Current Output:**
```
✅ Found 13 React/TypeScript files
✅ Components found: 0  ❌ Should be 11
```

**Recommendation:**
- Fix component extraction logic in `scripts/demo/analyze.ts`
- Add AST parsing to properly detect React components
- Should parse JSX/TSX and identify component exports

---

### Issue #3: Visualization Not Fully Interactive

**Problem:**
- Demo visualization generates static HTML
- Not using full D3.js renderer from `src/visual/`
- Limited interactivity compared to what's promised

**Impact:**
- New developers don't see the full power of Grafity
- Missing features: zoom, pan, search, advanced layouts
- Can't test the "real" visualization capabilities

**Recommendation:**
- Integrate `src/visual/renderers/GraphRenderer.ts` into demo
- Generate visualization using actual D3.js graph engine
- Add all interactive features to demo output

---

### Issue #4: No Real-Time Analysis Feedback

**Problem:**
- Demo scripts have no progress indicators
- Long-running operations appear frozen
- No way to know if analysis is working

**Impact:**
- Poor UX during analysis
- New developers may think tool is stuck
- No visibility into what's being analyzed

**Recommendation:**
- Add progress bars or spinners
- Show file-by-file analysis progress
- Add time estimates for long operations
