# Task 002: Document Confluence Graph & AI Chat Interface

## Vision Statement
Transform Grafity into a revolutionary platform where documents, ideas, and code are interconnected through intelligent visual graphs. Users will chat with AI agents through graph interfaces, where each conversation node can spawn connections to related ideas, documentation, and code implementations. This creates a living knowledge base where business context, technical documentation, and actual code are seamlessly linked.

## Problem Statement
Current development workflows suffer from:
- **Disconnected Documentation**: Business documents, technical specs, and code exist in isolation
- **Linear AI Interactions**: Traditional chat interfaces lose context and relationships between topics
- **Lost Business Context**: The "why" behind code gets lost in implementation details
- **Manual Knowledge Mapping**: Teams manually maintain connections between ideas and implementations

## Core Concept: The Confluence Graph

### What is a Confluence Graph?
A multi-dimensional knowledge graph that connects:
- **Document Nodes**: Paragraphs, sections, and documents as interconnected nodes
- **Idea Nodes**: Business concepts, user stories, and strategic goals
- **Code Nodes**: Components, functions, and data structures
- **Conversation Nodes**: AI chat interactions that become part of the knowledge graph
- **Relationship Edges**: Bi-directional connections with semantic meaning

### Key Innovation: Graph-Based AI Chat
Instead of linear chat:
1. Each message becomes a node in the graph
2. AI responses create connections to relevant documentation and code
3. Users navigate conversations spatially through the graph
4. Context is preserved through graph relationships, not just message history

## Implementation Requirements
