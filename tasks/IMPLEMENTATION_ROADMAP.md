## Implementation Phases

### 🔧 Phase 1: Claude Code CLI Integration (Week 1)
**Goal**: Integrate Claude as the AI layer for semantic understanding
- Install and configure Claude Code CLI
- Build wrapper for piping and JSON output
- Create AST and graph analysis commands
- Implement code generation pipeline

### ⚙️ Phase 2: Mechanical Analysis Pipeline (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Extract 100% accurate structural data using Nx and TypeScript AST
- Integrate Nx project graph API
- Build TypeScript AST visitor pattern
- Extract components, functions, types
- Create data flow analyzer

### 📊 Phase 3: Graph Engine Core (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: Build the central graph engine with bi-directional connections
- Define node and edge types
- Implement graph storage and queries
- Build graph connectors
- Create traversal algorithms

### 🎨 Phase 4: Visual Interface (Week 6-7)
**Goal**: Create interactive graph visualization
- Implement D3.js renderer
- Build interactive controls
- Create multi-level views
- Add real-time updates

### 💬 Phase 5: Graph-Based AI Chat (Week 8-10)
**Goal**: Transform linear chat into graph-based conversations
- Build conversation graph structure
- Create chat UI with graph visualization
- Connect to Claude for responses
- Link conversations to code/docs

### 🚀 Phase 6: Advanced Features (Week 11)
**Goal**: Add code generation and pattern learning
- Build graph-to-code generator
- Implement semantic search
- Add pattern learning
- Create plugin system

### 🖥️ Phase 7: Server Infrastructure (Week 11)
**Goal**: Build API and real-time capabilities
- Set up Express/GraphQL
- Implement WebSocket updates
- Add authentication
- Create job queue

### ✅ Phase 8: Testing & Deployment (Week 12)
**Goal**: Production readiness
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimization
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start with Phase 1 (Critical Path)
```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Begin implementation
cd tasks/
cat 003-phase1-claude-cli-integration.md
```

### 2. Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Phase 1 & 2** can be developed in parallel by different developers
- **Phase 4** (Visual) can start once Phase 3 has basic structure
- **Phase 6 & 7** can be developed in parallel

### 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
For a working MVP, complete:
1. Phase 1: Claude CLI (1 week)
2. Phase 2: Mechanical Analysis (1.5 weeks)
3. Phase 3: Graph Engine (2 weeks)
4. Basic visualization from Phase 4 (1 week)

**Total MVP Time**: ~5.5 weeks

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Graph can handle 10,000+ nodes
- API response time < 200ms
- 80% test coverage
- Real-time updates < 100ms

### User Experience Metrics
- Code to graph generation < 5 seconds
- Graph navigation feels smooth
- AI responses include relevant context
- Bi-directional connections are clear

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance with large graphs**
   - Mitigation: Implement virtualization and LOD

2. **AI response quality**
   - Mitigation: Fine-tune prompts, add validation

3. **Complex graph relationships**
   - Mitigation: Start simple, iterate on connections

### Schedule Risks
1. **Integration complexity**
   - Mitigation: Build integration tests early

2. **UI/UX iterations**
   - Mitigation: Get user feedback on mockups first

## Next Steps

1. **Review all task files** in order (003-010)
2. **Set up development environment**
3. **Start with Phase 1** - Claude Code CLI integration
4. **Create project board** with all tasks
5. **Begin daily progress tracking**

## Resources Needed

### Tools & Services
- Claude Code CLI license
- GitHub/GitLab for version control
- CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions)
- Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)

### Team Skills
- TypeScript/JavaScript expertise
