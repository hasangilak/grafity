# Task 001: AI-Consumable Graph Export & Bidirectional Human-AI Collaboration

## Problem Statement
We need to make the graph understandable for AI models and create a bidirectional system where:
- **Humans** can manipulate visual graphs → **AI** implements code changes
- **AI** modifies code → **Visual graphs** update automatically
- **Both** learn from each other's patterns and decisions

## Vision: Living Architecture Platform
Transform Grafity into a collaborative intelligence platform where business stakeholders, developers, and AI work together through visual interfaces, creating self-evolving software architecture.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Multi-Level Intelligence Layers
- **System Architecture Level**: Services, databases, external APIs
- **Business Flow Level**: User stories, data workflows, business processes
- **Component Level**: React components, functions, data structures
- **Implementation Level**: Actual code with live editing capabilities

### 2. Bidirectional Synchronization
- Real-time sync between visual graphs and actual code
- Drag-and-drop component relationships → Auto-generate/refactor code
- Code changes → Instant graph updates with change highlighting
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous human/AI changes

### 3. AI Integration Points
- **Pattern Recognition**: Architectural patterns, anti-patterns, code smells
- **Business Context**: Map code to business capabilities and domain models
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Performance bottlenecks, scaling suggestions
- **Code Generation**: From visual designs to implementation
